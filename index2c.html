    <h3>Class Attendance</h3>
        <div>
        <p>No educational experience can occur in the absence of the learner. When a student misses class, valuable information and resources essential to the Front-End Web Developer Certificate Program are lost. Lectures are not repeated. While we realize that students will occasionally need to miss class due to illness or other personal reasons, students need to keep absences to a minimum.</p>  
        <ul>
            <li>Students may NOT miss more than 10% of total hours per program. If students miss more than 10% of any class, they may be dropped from the program and will not be eligible for a certificate.</li>
            <li>Attendance is factored into the overall grade, if a student misses more than 10% of class time; they are NOT qualified for the certificate.</li>
            <li>Students may NOT make up missed hours in other classes.</li>
            <li>Students are encouraged to discuss with the instructor absences for special circumstances prior to the absence, if possible.</li>
            <li>Students may NOT be absent more than 3 consecutive days in a row per month. After three consecutive absences, the Instructor will drop the student from the program.</li>
            <li>Students are expected to arrive on time and stay for the duration of the class. If student leaves class early he/she must sign out.</li>
            <li>Students must sign in on the sign-In sheet each day when entering class. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to do so. If not, they are considered absent and do not get credit for hours attended.</li>
                 
        </ul>
